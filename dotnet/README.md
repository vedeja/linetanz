# dotnet

This folder contains an experimental LineTanz implementation in C# .NET. Its purpose is to enable development without an Arduino board and to have something that can be easily compared with DigiMixer. Plus, C# is really my homebase and I need to write something working, non-async before trying to port it to Arduino APL.
